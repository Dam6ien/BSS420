\section{Problem Statement}
Households produce a substantial amount of waste on a daily basis in order to continue operating. Food clippings and waste is often discarded into dustbins to be collected and transported elsewhere, water used at bathroom sinks is often disposed and not re-used within the household and kitchen layouts do not lend themselves towards easy recyling sorting and temporary storage.
