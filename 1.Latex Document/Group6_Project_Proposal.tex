\section{Problem Statement}
Households produce a substantial amount of waste on a daily basis in order to continue operating. Food clippings and waste is often discarded into dustbins to be collected and transported elsewhere, water used at bathroom sinks is often disposed and not re-used within the household and kitchen layouts do not lend themselves towards easy recyling sorting and temporary storage.

A typical residential household consists of numerous different systems; water supply and use, waste disposal and (?). With the drive towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly systems in recent years, it has become more important to individuals to ensure their households run in this manner by using water and electricity resources sparlingly and disposing of waste responsibly. However, at present, there is no complete system on the market to meet a consumer's needs. There are grey water systems, recycling bins and compost containers but no global solution (or system) that combines the operation of all these systems together to ensure one's household can be run in a sustainable manner.

\section{Deliverable}
