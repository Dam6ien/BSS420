\section{Problem Statement}
  Households consume and produce a variety of products and wastes. Products may take the form of food items, municipal water, electricity and other consumables which are used and then discarded, exiting the household as waste. For example, food clippings from preparing dinner or paper-based packaging is often discarded into dustbins along side plastic waste to be collected and transported elsewhere. Water used at bathroom sinks is disposed of and sent into the municipal water system. 

  A typical residential household consists of numerous different systems; water supply and use, waste disposal and (?). With the drive towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly systems in recent years, it has become more important to individuals to ensure their households run in this manner by using water and electricity resources sparlingly and disposing of waste responsibly. However, at present, there is no complete system on the market to meet a consumer's needs. There are grey water systems, recycling bins and compost containers but no global solution (or system) that combines the operation of all these systems together to ensure one's household can be run in a sustainable manner.

\section{Deliverable}
